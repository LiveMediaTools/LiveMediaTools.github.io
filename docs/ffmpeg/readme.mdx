# Introduction

FFmpeg is a very powerful and popular audio and video processing tool, but it operates through the command line, where the various parameters can be quite complex. The official documentation explains the usage of each parameter individually, but combining these parameters to meet specific needs can be challenging. Here, I will record some commonly used complete command lines that can be used directly. If you have any commonly used commands, feel free to share them!
